# PicProject Hack Night

This is a small Flask project that was worked on during a hack night lasting around 6-7 hours.
It uses the Imgur API to put images from different various categories head to head against head other to allow people to vote on which they like best.
The results are then aggregated and visualized in a simple bubble chart.
